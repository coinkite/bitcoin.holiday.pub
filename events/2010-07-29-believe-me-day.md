On July 29, 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto responded to a skeptic on the BitcoinTalk forum with this legendary line:

> *“If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”*

It was a moment that echoed far beyond the thread — a message that Bitcoin is not something to be sold, but something to be discovered.

This quote has since become a core part of Bitcoin culture. It represents conviction, self-sovereignty, and the unapologetic belief in decentralization.

Whether you were here early or joined late, one thing remains true:

**Bitcoin doesn't need to convince you. You need to catch up.**
